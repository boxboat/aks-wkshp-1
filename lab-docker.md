## Install Docker Desktop

Link: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

Once you have the Docker Desktop installed on your computer, launch a terminal and type the following command.

```shell
docker version

`docker version` command shows you information regarding the client (Desktop CLI) and serer (Desktop Engine).

## Pull and launch a container
You can pull pre-built container images from external registries such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com). Let's pull and launch an `alpine` container.

**Step 1: Pull the container**
```shell
docker pull alpine

# response
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/alpine
801bfaa63ef2: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:3c7497bf0c7af93428242d6176e8f7905f2201d8fc5861f45be7a346b5f23436
Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
docker.io/library/alpine:latest
```

**Step 2: Run the container and connect shell into it**
```shell
docker run --name alpine -ti alpine
# _
```
Docker CLI will launch the container and you can run commands insite the Linux container. Please note that any file changes you make in this container will be ephemeral. For containers that need to preserve file changes, you need to mound an external volume into the container.

**Step 3: Stop and delete the container**
You can `exit` out of the shell. It will also stop the container since there was no long running process inside it. In case of other applications, for example a web server, it will continue running as long as web server process is running. Once your containe is stopped, you can remove the container instance from the system.

```shell
docker rm alpine
```

## Pull and launch another container

**Step 1: Let's launch a webserver container.**

```shell
docker run --name hello-world -d -p 80:80 boxboat/hello-world
```

Notice that we didn't explicitly pull the `boxboat/hello-world` image from Docker hub. The CLI will notice that I don't have the image and it will pull it automatically.
 
 * `-n` gives the container a name so you can interact 
 * `-d` runs the container in detached mode, which means the container will run in the background and we don't get shell into it.
 * `-p` maps the container network port with your host network. Containers run in a separate virtual network. Docker desktop helps you do the mapping between the two interfaces.

 **Step 2: Check the running containers**
 
 ```shell
 docker ps

 #response
 CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                NAMES
b3c75af0d067   boxboat/hello-world   "/opt/hello-world/heâ€¦"   22 seconds ago   Up 18 seconds   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   hello-world
```
`docker ps` shows all running containers. We only have one at this  point. You can also see the ports mapping being done. You should be able to open a browser and view the website [http://localhost](http://localhost:80)

**Step 3: Check container logs**
```shell
docker logs hello-world
```

**Step 4: Exec into the conatiner**
```shell
docker exec -ti hello-world sh
```
Look around inside the container and when you are done `exit` out of it.

**Step 5: Stop and cleanup**
```shell
docker stop hello-world
docker rm hello-world
```

You can learn more about Docker CLI command [reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/)

## Build conatiners images

You can use a `Dockerfile` to build new container images. Dockerfile provides a simple syntax for building Linux or Windows containers. You can learn more about the Dockerfile [reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) Let's build a container for funfact application.

```shell
git pull git@github.com:faheem556/funfact.git
cd funfact

# build dotnet app
docker build -t funfact:dotnet-1-0 -f dotnet/Dockerfile ./funfact/dotnet

# build node image
docker build -t funfact:node-1-0 -f nodejs/Dockerfile ./funfact/nodejs

# build java image
docker build -t funfact:java-1-0 -f java/Dockerfile ./funfact/java
```

Example Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

# Copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY *.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore

# Copy everything else and build
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

# Build runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-env /app/out .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "funfact.dll"]
```


Read through the code and docker files to understand the environement. It's really straight-forward.

Let's run the application now.

```shell
docker run --name funfactd -d --rm -p 8080:80 funfact:dotnet-1-0 
docker run --name funfactn -d --rm -p 8081:80 funfact:node-1-0 
docker run --name funfactj -d --rm -p 8082:80 funfact:java-1-0 
docker ps
```

You should have three running containers at this point. If for some reason the container doesn't start, you can use `docker ps -a` and `docker log` to troubleshoot.

Once the containers are up, open you browsers and try out the applications.

**Cleanup**
```shell
docker stop funfactd
docker rm funfactd

docker stop funfactn
docker rm funfactd

docker stop funfactj
docker rm funfactj
```
